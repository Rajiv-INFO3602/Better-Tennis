          <p>Patrick’s first experience of coaching was with Marcos.

            After finishing the year as Junior World No. 1, the Cypriot reached the Australian Open final in 2006 to go head to head with Roger Federer. This was the high point of their partnership.
            
            That same year, Marcos went on to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals.</p>

          <p>I find it hard to define myself as a tennis coach or an instructor. I think of my work as going much further than this. The best word I would use to define it is “trainer”, with this definition not being limited to only the tennis court. It encompasses many other aspects which have led me to experience tennis as part of my life.</p>
